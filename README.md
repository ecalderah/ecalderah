## About Me

I'm a passionate student of Economics who truly enjoys Data Science, Econometrics, and Financial Analysis. Coming from a humanities background, I had to learn everything from scratch, and now, thanks to that human-centered perspective, I can apply my mathematical knowledge across various fields. My expertise spans:

- **Python** & **R**
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Trading**
- **Econometrics**
- **Macroeconomics**
- **Risk analytics and portafolio construction**

## Hobbies & Interests

Beyond code and data, I find inspiration in:
- Languages
- Studying music 🎵 
- Practicing sports 🏅
- Learning simply because I love to learn

## Featured Projects
